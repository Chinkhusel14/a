            <div class="item-title">NEGRONI</div>
            <div class="item-desc">It is said that the Negroni was born out of the Milano-Torino, which was invented in the 1860s at Caffe Camparino in Milan, Italy. Being popular among Americans who often requested for the drink to be modified with a splash of soda water, the name, Americano, was born.</div>

            <div class="item-title">MOJITO</div>
            <div class="item-desc">Local South American Indians were known to have remedies for many diseases, so a small party went ashore to Cuba and came back with ingredients for a medicine. They used aguarediente de cana, mint leaves, and the juices from sugar cane and limes to put together a tonic which turned out to be effective.</div>

            <div class="item-title">WHISKEY SOUR</div>
            <div class="item-desc">The first mention of the whiskey sour was in 1862 from The Bartenders Guide by Jerry Thomas. However, it's likely that people were drinking whiskey sours long before this. Like so many spirits and cocktails, we can thank sailors for this delicious cocktail.</div>

            <div class="item-title">PASSION MARGARITA</div>
            <div class="item-desc">The Margarita was invented in 1942 by a Mexican, now Mexican-American, named Francisco Morales. It was named after a flower, not a girl—though people joke about it being named after Francisco's wife, whom he married in 1956.</div>

            <div class="item-title">PINA COLODA</div>
            <div class="item-desc">The earliest known story states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, to boost his crew's morale, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple and white rum. This was what would be later known as the famous piña colada.</div>

            <div class="item-title">MAI TAI</div>
            <div class="item-desc">According to legend, after shaking the concoction with ice and presenting the cocktail to some of his visiting Tahitian friends, they ended up liking it so much one of them exclaimed, "Maita’i roa a’e," which translates to "out of this world! The best!" Bergeron christened his new cocktail "Mai Tai," as in "the best."</div>
