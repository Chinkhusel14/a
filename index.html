            <div class="item-desc">It is said that the Negroni was born out of the Milano-Torino, which was invented in the 1860s at Caffe Camparino in Milan, Italy. Being popular among Americans who often requested for the drink to be modified with a splash of soda water, the name, Americano, was born.</div>

            <h3>THE HISTORY OF COCKTAILS: ORIGIN STORY</h3>

            <img src="images\cocktail.jpg" alt="Cocktail" class="cocktail" /><p>
                Cocktails were initially inspired by British punches, which contained spirits, fruit juices, and spices in big bowls. The term “cocktail” was first seen on March 17, 1798, as referenced from a newspaper.

                There are several theories around why cocktails are called cocktails, the most popular of which relates to horse racing.

                Though the origin of mixed drinks can be traced back to the 17th century, it wasn’t clear where, who, and how the “original” cocktail was created.

                The first-ever reference to cocktails & mixology appeared in a spoof editorial in the Farmer’s Cabinet (Amherst, New Hampshire, April 28, 1803).

                It talked of a “lounger” who, while nursing an 11 a.m. hangover, “Drank a glass of cocktail – excellent for the head…”

                But it wasn’t until 1806 when The Balance and Columbian Repository of Hudson, New York pinned the definition down to what we know of cocktails today: “A stimulating liquor composed of any kind of sugar, water, and bitters.”

            <h4>THE ART OF BARTENDING</h4>
            <img src="images\bartender.jpg" alt="Bartender" />
            <p>
                As cocktails made their way into becoming a social badge of honour during the Shakespearean times, developments into the mood-altering effects of booze turned mixing drinks and bartending into big news.

                Jerry Thomas or Professor Thomas, an American bartender, helped define the art of bartending. Using the experience he gained from working all over Europe and America, he wrote “The Bartender’s Guide (or How to Mix Drinks).”

                It is one of the first comprehensive recipe books that became a standard-bearer for new and experienced bartenders alike, becoming a significant milestone from the Golden Age of the history of cocktails.

            <h4>EXPORTING OF ICE</h4>
            <img src="images\ice.jpg" alt="Ice" class="ice"/>
            <p>
                The story of how cocktails came to be will never be complete without mentioning the role of ancient, even primordial – ice!

                Before Frederic “Ice King” Tudor, ice was hard to transport.

                But thanks to his perseverance and dream of hauling it from colder climates to warmer ports, he made it possible for anyone to enjoy an iced drink at any time.

                This shift in availability influenced the invention and popularity of cocktails in and around the U.S., eventually fuelling their rise in other parts of the world as well.

            <h4>TIKI CULTURE</h4>
            <img src="images\tiki.jpeg" alt="tiki-cocktail" />
            <p>
                From the tourism and war-ravaged era, the Tiki culture started to rise. But it wasn’t until Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt’s (a.k.a. Don the Beachcomber) Hollywood restaurant was opened that the Tiki craze started.

                It became so popular that Gantt’s place later became a Polynesian hotspot.

                Meanwhile, Victor Bergeron (a.k.a. Trader Vic) opened his competing location in San Francisco around the same time, boosting the popularity of exotic tropical and colourful mixed drinks.

                The trend died down in the 1970s when the sluggish economy took a turn for the worse.

                High-end Tiki establishments were forced to close down, leaving behind colourful signature drinks to be recreated for years to come.
